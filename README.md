# Loan_Approval_PredictionðŸ’¼ Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning ðŸ§ 
This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model to determine whether a loan application should be approved or not â€” a key challenge in the financial industry. Using real-world-like data, I explored the end-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

ðŸš€ Highlights:

Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.

Achieved 90% accuracy with Random Forest, outperforming other models.

Evaluated models using precision, recall, and F1-score for both approved and rejected loan cases.

Conducted feature engineering, handling missing values, and visualized key trends to boost model performance.

Focused on building a balanced and interpretable model to support real-world business decisions in loan risk assessment.

ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
