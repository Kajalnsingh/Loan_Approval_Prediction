#Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning 🧠
This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model to determine whether a loan application should be approved or not — a key challenge in the financial industry. Using real-world-like data, I explored the end-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

📌 Project Steps
Data Import & Understanding:
Loaded the dataset from Kaggle and explored its structure and key features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Identified missing values, outliers, and feature relationships through visualizations.

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values

Performed feature scaling

Applied oversampling techniques (to balance class distribution)

Model Building & Evaluation:
Applied the following models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

✔️ Best Accuracy Achieved: 90% (Random Forest)
📈 Evaluated using precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

📚 Outcome
Successfully built and evaluated models for loan approval prediction, with strong performance using ensemble methods. This project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, model selection, and real-world evaluation.
