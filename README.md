#Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning 🧠
This project focuses on building a predictive machine learning model to determine whether a loan application should be approved or not — a key challenge in the financial industry. Using real-world-like data, I explored the end-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model deployment.

📊 Dataset
📁 Source: Kaggle
🧾 Contains demographic and financial details of loan applicants
🎯 Target: Predict whether a loan should be approved (Loan_Status)

🚀 Workflow Overview

🔍 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized trends, patterns, and missing values
Identified key features influencing loan approvals

🛠️ 2. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing data
Applied feature scaling for numerical stability
Used oversampling techniques to fix class imbalance

🤖 3. Model Building & Evaluation
Trained and tested three powerful models
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
